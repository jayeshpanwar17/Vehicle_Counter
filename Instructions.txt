# Vehicle Counter Project – Setup Instructions

## Folder Structure

Make sure all files and folders are placed inside one main folder. Recommended name:
vehicle_counter_project/

The folder should contain the following:

├── app.py
├── backend.py
├── yolov8n.pt
├── current_camera_location.txt
├── templates/
│   ├── selection.html
│   └── dashboard.html

If any file is missing or outside this structure, the project may not work as expected.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.8+ recommended).

2. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
   Example:
   - On Windows:
     cd Desktop\vehicle_counter_project
   - On Linux/Mac:
     cd ~/Desktop/vehicle_counter_project

3. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows)
   source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)

4. Install dependencies:
   pip install flask opencv-python ultralytics numpy

## 🏁 Running the Project

⚠️ Follow this order:

### Step 1: Start the vehicle detection system

Run this in terminal:
python backend.py

- This will start capturing the video feed
- Vehicles will be detected and counted
- Data will be stored in a database and a CSV log

### Step 2: Start the dashboard (Flask app)

In a new terminal window/tab, run:
python app.py

- A browser window will open
- Choose a location
- View real-time traffic dashboard

## 💡 Notes

- Make sure `yolov8n.pt` is in the same folder as `backend.py`
- `current_camera_location.txt` will be updated when you select a location in the dashboard
- SQLite database `vehicle_data.db` will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
- Logs are saved in the `logs/` folder

✅ Project is now ready.
